# TBBTbot Tutorial

A reddit bot built using Python3 and the Python Reddit API Wrapper package.

## Requirements
- Python3
- Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW)

## Project Description
This project was to create a RedditBot that monitors posts in a subreddit that I am a mod for, [/r/bigbangtheory](http://www.reddit.com/r/bigbangtheory). The bot monitors posts for various keywords in the submission title that would suggest that the post contains spoilers, and will reply if one of the words is found. The goal is to cut down on new episodes being ruined for viewers.

## Decisions
For the initial build, I used an if conditional to test for keywords that I believe are prevalent in the spoiler posts I've seen on the subreddit: "[spoilers]", "promo", and "photos". As time goes on, I'll update this list to check for other words as necessary.
